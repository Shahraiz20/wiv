### Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical ml to deep
learning, supervised, and unsupervised learning. Whether you prefer to write Python or R code or zerocode/low-code options such as the designer, you can build, train, and track highly accurate machine
learning and deep-learning models in an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

Azure Machine Learning provides all the tools developers and data scientists need for their machine
learning workflows, including:

• The [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score)designer (preview): drag-n-drop modules to build your experiments
and then deploy pipelines.

• Jupyter notebooks: use our [example notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) or create your own notebooks to leverage
our [SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py) samples for your machine learning.

• R scripts or notebooks in which you use the [SDK for R](https://azure.github.io/azureml-sdk-for-r/reference/index.html) to write your own code, or use the R
modules in the designer.

• [Visual Studio Code extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-setup-vscode-extension)

• [Machine learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli)

• Open-source frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn and many more

• You can even use [MLflow to track metrics and deploy models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow) or Kubeflow to [build end-to-end
workflow pipelines.](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/)
