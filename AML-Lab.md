### Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical ml to deep
learning, supervised, and unsupervised learning. Whether you prefer to write Python or R code or zerocode/low-code options such as the designer, you can build, train, and track highly accurate machine
learning and deep-learning models in an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

Azure Machine Learning provides all the tools developers and data scientists need for their machine
learning workflows, including:

• The [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score)designer (preview): drag-n-drop modules to build your experiments
and then deploy pipelines.

• Jupyter notebooks: use our [example notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) or create your own notebooks to leverage
our [SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py) samples for your machine learning.

• R scripts or notebooks in which you use the [SDK for R](https://azure.github.io/azureml-sdk-for-r/reference/index.html) to write your own code, or use the R
modules in the designer.

• [Visual Studio Code extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-setup-vscode-extension)

• [Machine learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/reference-azure-machine-learning-cli)

• Open-source frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn and many more

• You can even use [MLflow to track metrics and deploy models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow) or Kubeflow to [build end-to-end
workflow pipelines.](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/azure/)



A [taxonomy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-workspace) of the workspace is illustrated in the following diagram:

![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--002.png)

• Provide the following information to configure your new workspace.

   ## **Field** :                                    **Description**

**Workspace name** :    Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. Names must be unique across
                    the resource group. Use a name that is easy to recall and to differentiate from
                    workspaces created by others. The workspace name is case-insensitive.
                    
**Subscription**   :    Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.

**Resource group** : Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a
                     new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure
                     solution.

**Location**.      : Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your
                     workspace.
                     
**Workspace edition**  :  Select Enterprise. This workspace edition determines the features to which you'll
                          have access and pricing. Learn more about [Basic and Enterprise edition offerings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-                           is-azure-ml#sku).
                          
                          
![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--003.png)

the settings, select **Create**.

• To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**

### Create Compute

**Create Compute Cluster**

An Azure Machine Learning compute instance (preview) is a fully managed cloud-based workstation for
data scientists. Compute instances make it easy to get started with Azure Machine Learning
development as well as provide management and enterprise readiness capabilities for IT administrators.
Use a compute instance as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud.
Compute instances are typically used as development environments. They can also be used as a
compute target for training and inferencing for development and testing. For large tasks, an [Azure
Machine Learning compute cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-set-up-training-targets#amlcompute) with multi-node scaling capabilities is a better compute target choice.

We will do several actions that require a compute target to be executed on. We will start by creating a
cluster of CPUs VMs.

   • Sign in at https://ml.azure.com.
       
   • Select Compute in the Assets section of the left pane.
       
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--004.png)
       
   • Navigate to Compute > Compute Clusters in the Manage section and click New
       
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--005.png)
       
   • **Name** the cluster cpucluster.
 
   • Name the cluster cpucluster.
       
   • **Virtual machine**type CPU
       
   • For **machine size** choose Standard_DS2_v2.
       
   • Set the **Minimum number of nodes** to 0 and the **Maximum number of nodes** to 4. That way the
         cluster will scale automatically to up to 4 nodes as jobs require them.
       
   • Set the **Idle seconds before scaling down** to 600. That means that nodes will be kept around for
         10 minutes before they are spun down. That way, during our workshop, jobs will not have to
         wait for spin-up. Make sure that number is lower if you are using a more expensive VM size.
         
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--006.png)
         
   • Click Create.
   
   • Wait for the provisioning state to be “Succeeded”
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--007.png)
   
 
 
 **Create Compute Instance**

Next, we will create a Compute Instance. The Compute Instance will serve as an interactive workstation
in the cloud that serves as a Jupyter server, but also hosts and instance of RStudio server and can run
TensorBoard, Bokeh, Shiny or other apps used during the development work of a Data Scientist.

   • Navigate to Compute Instances tab in the Compute section and click on New
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--008.png)
   
   • Choose some sufficiently unique name, keep the default VM type (STANDARD_DS3_V2 - a fairly
     inexpensive machine type costing).
     
     ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--009.png)
     
   • Click Create.
   
   • Wait for it to change the status to “Running”.
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--010.jpg)
   
   • **Note that this machine will keep running until you stop it!**
   
   
### Create Dataset
   
With Azure Machine Learning datasets, you can:
   • Keep a single copy of data in your storage, referenced by datasets.

   • Seamlessly access data during model training without worrying about connection strings or data
paths.

   • Share data and collaborate with other users.
   
   
There are two dataset types, based on how users consume them in training:
   • [TabularDataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.tabulardataset?view=azure-ml-py) represents data in a tabular format by parsing the          provided file or list of files. This provides you with the ability to materialize the data into a Pandas or Spark DataFrame. You can create a TabularDataset object from .csv,      .tsv, .parquet, .jsonl files, and from SQL query results. For a complete list, see TabularDatasetFactory class.

   • The [FileDataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.data.file_dataset.filedataset?view=azure-ml-py) class references single or multiple files        in your datastores or public URLs. By this method, you can download or mount the files to your compute as a FileDataset object. The files can be in any format, which enables      a wider range of machine learning scenarios, including deep learning.
   
Once you have created an instance of Azure Machine Learning, select 'Launch Azure Machine Learning
studio' (or browse to [https://ml.azure.com/](https://ml.azure.com/))

By creating a dataset, you create a reference to the data source location, along with a copy of its
metadata. To create a dataset in the studio:
  
   • Sign in at https://ml.azure.com.
  
   • Select Datasets in the Assets section of the left pane.
  
  ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--011.png)
  
   • Select Create Dataset to choose the source of your dataset. This source can be local files, a
     datastore, or public URLs. For our workshop we will upload the data from local files.

  ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--012.png)
  
   • Select Tabular for Dataset type and give your dataset a name.
  
  ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--013.png)
  
   • Select Next to open the Datastore and file selection form. On this form you select where to keep
     your dataset after creation, as well as select what data files to use for your dataset. Select
     Browse and upload the file from your local desktop. Keep rest of the default values.
 
  ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--014.png)
  
   • Select Next to populate the Settings and preview and Schema forms; they are intelligently
     populated based on file type and you can further configure your dataset prior to creation on
     these forms. Change the Column header to “All files have same header”. Ensure the rest of the
     setting and preview of the data.
    
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--015.png)
   
   • Select Next to review the Schema and Data type.
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--016.png)
   
   • Select Next to review the Confirm details form. Check your selections and create an data profile
     for your dataset. Learn more about [data profiling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models#profile).
     
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--017.png)
   
   • Select Create to complete your dataset creation.
   
   • Dataset should be registered and available for use.
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--018.png)
   
   • You can register a new dataset under the same name by creating a new version. A dataset
     version is a way to bookmark the state of your data so that you can apply a specific version of
     the dataset for experimentation or future reproduction. Learn more about dataset versions.

   • Once the data profile is completed (profile generation), you can get a vast variety of summary
     statistics across your data set to verify whether your data set is ML-ready. For non-numeric
     columns, they include only basic statistics like min, max, and error count. For numeric columns,
     you can also review their statistical moments and estimated quantiles.
     
     
  ## **Statistic** :                                    **Description**
  
 **Feature** : Name of the column that is being summarized.
  
 **Profile** :  In-line visualization based on the type inferred. For example, strings, booleans, and dates will have value counts, while decimals (numerics) have approximated                    histograms. This allows you to gain a quick understanding of the distribution of the data.

**Type distribution** : In-line value count of types within a column. Nulls are their own type, so this visualization is useful for detecting odd or missing values.

**Type** : Inferred type of the column. Possible values include: strings, booleans, dates, and decimals.

**Min** :  Minimum value of the column. Blank entries appear for features whose type does not have an inherent ordering (e.g. booleans).

**Max** :  Maximum value of the column.

**Count** :  Total number of missing and non-missing entries in the column.

**Not missing count** : Number of entries in the column that are not missing. Empty strings and errors are treated as values, so they will not contribute to the "not missing                               count."

**Quantiles** :  Approximated values at each quantile to provide a sense of the distribution of the data.

**Mean** : Arithmetic mean or average of the column.

**Standard deviation** : Measure of the amount of dispersion or variation of this column's data.

**Variance** :  Measure of how far spread out this column's data is from its average value.

**Skewness** :  Measure of how different this column's data is from a normal distribution.

**Kurtosis** :  Measure of how heavily tailed this column's data is compared to a normal distribution.

![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--019.png)

   • Now, click on the newly created dataset and click Explore. Here you can see the fields of the
     Tabular dataset.
     
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--020.png)
   
   To view the profile of the dataset we generated in the previous step, click the Profile tab. If you
   want to regenerate a profile (or you created the dataset without selecting the profile option), you can
   click Generate profile and select a cluster to generate profile information for the dataset.
   
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--021.png)
   
   • In the Consume tab we can find a short code snippet for consuming the dataset from Notebooks. 
     
   ![](Images/images:aml:.png/image--022.png)
   
   • For more information on datasets, see the [how-to for more information on creating and using Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-      register-datasets).
   
  
  
  ## Automated Machine Learning
  
Automated machine learning (automated ML) builds high quality machine learning models for you by
automating model and hyperparameter selection. Bring a labelled dataset that you want to build a
model for, and automated ML will give you a high quality machine learning model that you can use for
predictions.

If you are new to Data Science, automated ML will help you get jumpstarted by simplifying machine
learning model building. It abstracts you from needing to perform model selection, hyperparameter
selection and in one step creates a high-quality trained model for you to use.

If you are an experienced data scientist, automated ML will help increase your productivity by
intelligently performing the model and hyperparameter selection for your training and generates high
quality models much quicker than manually specifying several combinations of the parameters and
running training jobs. Automated ML provides visibility and access to all the training jobs and the
performance characteristics of the models to help you further tune the pipeline if you desire.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-automated-ml-for-ml-models) in the documentation for a full overview of the user interface.
