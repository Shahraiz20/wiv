# Building a Chat Bot with the Azure Bot Service


Software bots are everywhere. You probably interact with them every day without
realizing it. Bots, especially chat and messenger bots, are changing the way we interact
with businesses, communities, and even each other. Thanks to light-speed advances in
artificial intelligence (AI) and the ready availability of AI services, bots are not only
becoming more advanced and personalized, but also more accessible to developers.

Regardless of the target language or platform, developers building bots face a variety of
challenges. Bots must be able process input and output intelligently. Bots need to be
responsive, scalable, and extensible. They need to work cross-platform, and they need to
interact with users in a conversational manner and in the language that the user
chooses.

[The Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/), combined with [Microsoft QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/), provide the tools
developers need to build and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users
using a range of services. In this lab, you will create a bot using the Azure Bot Service
and connect it to a knowledge base built with QnA Maker. Then you will interact with
the bot using Skype — one of many popular services with which bots built with the
Azure Bot Service can integrate.

# Case description

A bot is an autonomous program that interacts with people or computer systems in a
predictable way. The logic behind a bot is designed and programmed by the bot
creator, often with the help of tools like the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft also has
other AI services, included in Azure Cognitive Services, that can enhance the capabilities
of your bots.

QnA Maker is one of the AI services that can help a bot answer your users' natural
language questions by matching them with the best possible answers from your
knowledge base.

# What is the QnA Maker

QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that easily
creates a natural conversational layer over your data. It can be used to find the most
appropriate answer for any given natural language input, from your custom knowledge
base (KB) of information.

A client application for QnA Maker is any conversational application that communicates
with a user in natural language to answer a question. Examples of client applications
include social media apps, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop applications.

## Add personality with Chit-Chat

Adding chit-chat to your bot makes it more conversational and engaging. The chit-chat
feature in QnA maker allows you to easily add a pre-populated set of the top chit-chat,
into your knowledge base (KB). This can be a starting point for your bot's personality,
and it will save you the time and cost of writing them from scratch.

This dataset has about 100 scenarios of chit-chat in the voice of multiple personas, like
Professional, Friendly and Witty.

Some examples of the different personalities are below. You can see all the
personality [datasets](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat/tree/master/CSharp/Datasets) along with details of the personalities.

For the user query of When is your birthday?, each personality has a styled response:

## Personality : Example

**Professional** : Age doesn't really apply to me.

**Friendly** : I don't really have an age.
 
**Witty** : I'm age-free.

**Caring** : I don't have an age.

**Enthusiastic** : I'm a bot, so I don't have an age.

## Add Chit-Chat in your KB

1. Download the English friendly [datasets on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat/tree/master/CSharp/Datasets)

2. Go to qnamaker.ai portal. Select your KB and select **Settings** from the top menu.

3. Scroll down to **Manage knowledge base**

4. On **File name** sub section, click on **Add file** and add qna_chitchat_friendly.tsv file.

![](Images/images:chatbot:.png/image--018.png)

1. Click **Save and Train** from top menu.

2. Click on **Edit** for review the questions and answers.

3. Select the last page of questions and answers from the bottom of the table. The
page shows questions and answers from the Chit-chat personality.

4. From the toolbar above the list of questions and answers, select the View options
icon, and then select Show metadata. This shows the metadata tags for each
question and answer. The Chit-chat questions have the editorial: chit-chat
metadata already set. This metadata is returned to the client application, along
with the selected answer. The client application, such as a chat bot, can use this
filtered metadata to determine additional processing or interactions with the
user.

 ![](Images/images:chatbot:.png/image--019.png)

1. Select the **Publish** button from the top menu. On the publish page,
select **Publish**.

### *Use cURL to query for a Chit-chat answer*

1. In the cURL-enabled terminal, replace How large can my KB be? with a bot
conversation-ending statement from the user, such as Thank you.

2. Run the cURL command and receive the JSON response, including the score and
answer.

3. % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current

4. Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed

5. 100 525 100 501 100 24 525 25 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 550{

6. "answers": [

7. {

8. "questions": [

9. "Thank you",

10. "Thanks",

11. "Thnx",

12. "Kthx",

13. "I appreciate it",

14. "Thank you so much",

15. "I thank you",

16. "My sincere thank"

17. ],

18. "answer": "You're very welcome.",

19. "score": 100.0,

20. "id": 109,

21. "source": "qna_chitchat_the_friend.tsv",

22. "metadata": [

23. {

24. "name": "editorial",

25. "value": "chitchat"

26. }

27. ]

28. }

29. ]

30. }

31.

Because the question of Thank you exactly matched a Chit-chat question, QnA
Maker is completely confident with the score of 100. QnA Maker also returned all
the related questions, as well as the metadata property containing the Chit-chat
metadata tag information.


## *Chat with the bot*

Go back in **Test in Web Chat** on Azure Portal and chat with your bot.
